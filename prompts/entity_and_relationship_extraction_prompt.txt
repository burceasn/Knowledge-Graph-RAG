# Knowledge Graph Extraction Prompt

You are tasked with extracting key entities and relationships from research paper abstracts to build a knowledge graph. Focus on identifying the most important and specific entities that are directly relevant to the paper's core contributions.

## Entity Types
{entity_types}

## Extraction Guidelines

### Step 1: Understand the Paper's Core
First, read through the abstract and identify:
- What is the main research problem or question?
- What method/approach/system is proposed?
- What are the key findings or contributions?
- What specific tools, datasets, or resources are mentioned?

### Step 2: Entity Extraction (Maximum 6-8 entities)
Think carefully about which entities are MOST important to understanding this paper. For each entity:

**Selection Criteria:**
- Must be specific and concrete (not generic concepts like "problem" or "solution")
- Directly mentioned or clearly implied in the text
- Central to the paper's contribution or methodology
- If multiple similar entities exist, choose the most specific one

**Special Cases:**
- For GitHub/code repositories: Use the full URL as entity_name (e.g., "https://github.com/Link-AGI/AutoAgents")
- For named systems/frameworks: Use the exact name as it appears (e.g., "AutoAgents", not "AUTOAGENTS framework")
- For datasets/benchmarks: Include specific names when mentioned

**Entity Information:**
- entity_name: The specific name (use original capitalization for proper nouns, URLs for repositories)
- entity_type: Choose from [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: A concise summary (1-2 sentences) that captures the entity's role in THIS paper, not generic definitions. You should use **Brief but Comprehensive Summary**

### Step 3: Relationship Extraction
For each pair of related entities:

**Relationship Criteria:**
- There must be a clear, direct connection stated or strongly implied in the text
- The relationship should be meaningful for understanding the paper's contribution
- Avoid trivial or overly general relationships

**Relationship Strength (1-10 scale):**
- 9-10: Core relationship essential to the paper (e.g., proposed method solving main problem)
- 7-8: Important supporting relationship (e.g., method using specific technique)
- 5-6: Relevant but secondary relationship (e.g., comparison with baseline)
- 3-4: Mentioned but peripheral relationship
- 1-2: Weak or indirect connection

**Relationship Information:**
- source: entity name (exact match from Step 2)
- target: entity name (exact match from Step 2), should not be the same as source
- relationship: concise verb/phrase describing the connection
- relationship_description: Brief explanation of the specific connection in this paper's context
- relationship_strength: integer from 1-10 based on importance to the paper

## Chain of Thought Process

Before providing the final output, think through:
1. What are the 3-5 most important things someone should know about this paper?
2. Which entities directly represent these important aspects?
3. Are there any specific names, tools, or resources that should be captured exactly as mentioned?
4. Which relationships are actually essential vs. just mentioned in passing?

## Output Format
Provide your response as a JSON object with two arrays:
- "entities": array of entity objects
- "relationships": array of relationship objects

## Example Thinking Process
For a paper about "AutoAgents: A Framework for Automatic Agent Generation":
- Core contribution: AutoAgents framework (specific system - keep exact name)
- Problem addressed: Limited adaptability in multi-agent systems (specific limitation)
- Key innovation: Dynamic agent generation (specific capability)
- Resource: https://github.com/Link-AGI/AutoAgents (exact URL)
- Avoid: Generic terms like "benchmarks", "experiments", "results" unless specifically named
