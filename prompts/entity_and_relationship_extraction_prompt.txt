# Knowledge Graph Extraction Prompt for Academic Papers

You are an expert at extracting entities and relationships from academic papers to build an interconnected knowledge graph. Your goal is to identify both paper-specific contributions AND reusable concepts that can connect multiple papers.

## Entity Extraction Strategy

### Core Principle: Hierarchical Entity Structure
Extract entities at THREE levels of specificity:
1. **Paper-Specific Entity** (1 required): The main contribution/system/framework unique to this paper
2. **Domain Concepts** (3-5 entities): Reusable technical concepts that could appear in multiple papers
3. **Supporting Elements** (2-3 entities): Specific tools, datasets, or resources mentioned

### Step 1: Identify the Paper's Core Contribution (1 entity)
**This is the MOST IMPORTANT entity** - it represents what makes this paper unique:
- For system/framework papers: Use the exact system name (e.g., "GraphRAG", "AutoAgents", "HiRAG")
- For method papers: Use the proposed method name
- For study/analysis papers: Use the main finding or approach name
- This entity should have entity_type = "METHOD" or "TOOL" typically
- Description should summarize the paper's unique contribution in 2-3 sentences

### Step 2: Extract Domain Concepts (4-6 entities)
These are **reusable concepts** that could appear across multiple papers:
- General techniques used (e.g., "RAG", "Knowledge Graph", "Graph Neural Networks")
- Problem categories (e.g., "Query-Focused Summarization", "Multi-Agent Systems")
- Evaluation approaches (e.g., "Benchmark Evaluation", "Human Evaluation")
- Core technical concepts (e.g., "Large Language Models", "Entity Extraction", "Semantic Understanding")

**Key Rule**: If a concept could reasonably appear in 3+ papers in this domain, include it as a domain concept.

### Step 3: Extract Supporting Elements (1-2 entities)
These provide specific details:
- Named datasets or benchmarks (if specifically mentioned)
- GitHub repositories (use full URL as entity_name)
- Specific baseline systems being compared
- Named evaluation metrics

### Entity Guidelines:
- **Prefer existing entities**: If you've seen this concept in other papers, use the EXACT SAME name
- **Standardize naming**: 
  - For acronyms, provide the full name followed by the acronym in parentheses. For example: Large Language Model (LLM).
  - Use title case for proper nouns
  - Use lowercase for general concepts unless they're acronyms
- **Balance specificity**: Not everything needs to be paper-specific

## Relationship Extraction Strategy

### Relationship Priority (extract in this order):
1. **Core relationships** (strength 9-10):
   - [Paper-Specific Entity] → solves/addresses → [Problem/Challenge]
   - [Paper-Specific Entity] → uses/leverages → [Core Technique]
   - [Paper-Specific Entity] → improves_upon → [Baseline/Previous Work]

2. **Technical relationships** (strength 6-8):
   - [Domain Concept] → enables → [Another Domain Concept]
   - [Method] → evaluated_on → [Dataset/Benchmark]
   - [System] → integrates → [Component/Technique]

3. **Contextual relationships** (strength 3-5):
   - [Concept] → related_to → [Concept]
   - [Tool] → available_at → [Repository]

### Relationship Description:
- Focus on HOW the relationship manifests in THIS paper
- Keep descriptions to 1-2 sentences
- Use present tense for current relationships, past tense for comparisons

## Output Requirements

### Maximum Entities: 8-10 total
- 1 paper-specific core entity (required)
- 3-5 domain concepts (required)
- 2-3 supporting elements (optional)

### Minimum Relationships: 5-7
- At least 2 involving the paper-specific entity
- At least 2 between domain concepts
- Focus on meaningful connections, not every possible pair

## Example Analysis

For "GraphRAG: A Graph-Based Approach to Query-Focused Summarization":

**Paper-Specific Entity:**
- GraphRAG (METHOD) - The specific framework proposed

**Domain Concepts (reusable across papers):**
- RAG (METHOD) - General retrieval-augmented generation
- Query-Focused Summarization (PROBLEM) - The general problem area  
- Knowledge Graph (CONCEPT) - General graph structure concept
- Large Language Models (CONCEPT) - Foundation technology

**Supporting Elements:**
- Community Summaries (METHOD) - Specific technique in GraphRAG
- Global Questions (PROBLEM) - Specific challenge addressed

**Key Relationships:**
- GraphRAG → extends → RAG (strength: 10)
- GraphRAG → addresses → Query-Focused Summarization (strength: 9)
- GraphRAG → constructs → Knowledge Graph (strength: 9)
- RAG → fails_on → Global Questions (strength: 7)
- Knowledge Graph → enables → Community Summaries (strength: 8)

## Extraction Process

1. Read the abstract and identify the ONE thing that makes this paper unique
2. List concepts that you've seen or expect to see in related papers
3. Note any specific resources, tools, or datasets
4. Build relationships that show both the paper's contribution AND its connection to the broader field
